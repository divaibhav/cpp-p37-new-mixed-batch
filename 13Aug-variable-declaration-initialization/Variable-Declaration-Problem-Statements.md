### Variable Declaration and Initialization Problem Statements
1. Write a program to declare variable of all the different datatypes like `int`, `float`, `double`, `char` and `bool`.
2. Write a program to declare and initialize variable of all the different datatypes like `int`, `float`, `double`, `char` and `bool`.
3. Write a program to declare and initialize following variables:
    1.  ```
        int roll_number = 21;
        float total_marks = 498;
        double temprature = 28.7;
        ```
        Print the value of these variables on console.
4. Write a program to declare `int number1` and `int number2`. Initialize `number1` by value 35 and `number2` by variable number1. Hint `number2` can be initialize by another variable `number1` as following way `number2 = number1`.
