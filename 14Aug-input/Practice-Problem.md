### Input and Arithmetic Problems
1. Write a program to accept two integer `number1` and `number2` form user. Calculate and print the `sum` of two entered number.
2. Write a program to accept three integer `number1`, `number2` and `number3` from user. Print the values of `number1`, `number2` and `number3` on console.
3. Write a program to accept three integer `number1`, `number2` and `number3` from user. Perform addition of `number1` and `number2` and store the result in `sum` variable. Perform subtraction of `number3` and `sum` and store the result in `subtraction` variable. Print the values of `sum` and `subtraction` on console.
4. Write a program to accept two numbers `numerator` and `denominator` of type `float` from user. Perform division and store the result in `quotient` variable. Print the value of `quotient` on the console.
5. Write a program to accept two numbers `numerator` and `denominator` of type `int` from user. Perform modulo-division and store the result in `remainder` variable. Print the value of `remainder` on the console.
6. Write a program to solve the given expression ```result = number1 + number2 - number3 * number4 / number5```. Accept `number1`, `number2`, `number3`, `number4` and `number5` of type `int` form user. Print the result on the console in the below format.
```
    Sample Input
    number1 = 10
    number2 = 20
    number3 = 5
    number4 = 10
    number5 = 2

    Ouptut format
    10 + 20 - 5 * 10 / 2 = 5
```

11. Write a program that calculates the energy needed to
heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water.

    >The formula to compute the energy is
    >Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184

    >where M is the weight of water in kilograms temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.

12. If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following formula:

    >interest = balance x (annualInterestRate/1200)

    Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and displays the interest for the next month.
13. Ravi and Shyam were playing a game. In the first turn of the game, Ravi will give an integer dividend and an integer divisor to Shyam. Then Shyam has to tell him the remainder of the division. In the second turn, Shyam will repeat the procedure. 

    To help them, please write a program that accepts Dividend, and Divisor from the user and print the remainder on the console.
